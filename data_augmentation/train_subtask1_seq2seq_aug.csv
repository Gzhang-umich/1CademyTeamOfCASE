"OPINION India ’ s Pakistan problem is Pakistan ’ s problem too December 03 , 2008 00:00 IST Siddharth Varadarajan If politics and emotion do not dictate India ’ s response , the terrorist strikes in Mumbai could be a catalyst for ending the Pakistani military ’ s fatal patronage of jihadi groups .",1
"In the charged atmosphere generated by the dangerous currents of domestic politics and media-induced panic , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is finding himself under tremendous pressure to respond decisively to initial evidence that ‘ elements in Pakistan ’ were responsible for last week ’ s terrorist outrage in Mumbai .",0
External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee got off to a sober and dignified start last week when he told his Pakistani counterpart that the elements responsible for the carnage did not want a “ leap forward ” in relations between India and Pakistan and were hence acting against Islamabad ’ s interests as well .,0
"And on Monday , India issued a demarche to Pakistan in which it said it expected “ strong action ” against those responsible for the attacks , “ whosoever they may be . ” But with TV channels declaring “ enough is enough ” and calling for the start of a “ real war ” on terror , the government finds itself increasingly on the back foot .",0
Too early It is too early to say how these demands for an immediate and decisive response to what happened in Mumbai will affect relations with Pakistan .,0
One would have thought the futility of offensive troop deployments and the suspension or downgrading of normal transport and diplomatic relations — methods the BJP-led Vajpayee government unsuccessfully tried after the terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 — would be apparent by now .,0
"“ But as the political and media pressure mounts , it becomes harder for us to exercise those options . ” The executioners of the terrorist attack on Pakistan , of course , would like nothing better than for India to get trapped into an aggressive , and preferably , military response .",0
"Thanks to the providential arrest of a terrorist in Mumbai and his subsequent interrogation , the police are asserting with a considerable degree of confidence that the LeT planned and orchestrated the attacks that took the lives of more than 180 people .",1
"Whether the terrorists who attacked Mumbai belong to a group that has attacked Pakistani targets or had handlers with links to elements within the Pakistani military establishment , there is enough evidence to suggest that it is impossible for GHQ in Rawalpindi to firewall the two .",0
The brutal murder of Daniel Pearl showed the ease with which a ‘ Kashmir-inspired ’ terrorist like Omar Saeed Sheikh could make the al - Qaeda ’ s agenda his own .,0
And the deliberate targeting of U.S. and British citizens and Jews in the Mumbai attacks should be a further reminder to Washington of the danger of allowing groups like LeT any breathing space .,0

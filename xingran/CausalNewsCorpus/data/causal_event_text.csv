"But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S.",1

"",1
"Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that do n't yet seem fully engaged .",1
"Despite these early successes , the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation .",1
"The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war .",1
"Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week , starting at noon Saturday .",1
"After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait , he offered him a week to withdraw fully , instead of the four days he originally considered , because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic .",1
"Meanwhile , the U.S. hopes , economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages . That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power .",1
"If that 's true , the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within .",1
"Yet , paradoxically , the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein 's support within the Iraqi military .",1

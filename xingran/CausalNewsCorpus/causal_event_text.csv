“ It was a planned attack instigated by the PMK , who are trying to gain political mileage , ” he charged and added that members of a community in 30 villages , spread across political parties , joined the PMK-led assault .
This was to thwart economic well-being of the population .
“ They blocked access to the villages by cutting down trees .

He said some 200 protesters became violent , and traffic had to be diverted .
The roads were first closed at 4:45am after protesters blockaded them with burning tyres .
That apparent calm was shattered in late December , when security forces shot four militants who allegedly attempted to blow up a Communist party building in southern Xinjiang .

Babudom strikes back , former official pays for leprosy home agitation Posted : Fri Feb 12 1999 IST NEW DELHI , February 11 : The Department of Social Welfare today suspended a former superintendent of the Tahirpur Custodial Home for Leprosy Patients for " instigating ' ' the agitation of leprosy patients .
The three-day hunger strike of the patients -- demanding the withdrawal of the transfer of two officials -- ended yesterday after the Social Welfare Minister Krishna Tirath assured them that the transfer will be reconsidered .
" This has led the department to conclude that I prompted the idea of an agitation among the inmates after the two officials were transferred , ' ' he said .
According to Singh , his suspension and the hunger strike were the result of an argument between Prasad and S.C. Tyagi , a deputy director at the Department of Social Welfare .
Sagar denied that there was a fight between Tyagi and Prasad and added that the leprosy patients assaulted him when he went there to deliver the transfer orders .
Within seconds he had been thrown to the ground by the “ revolutionary masses ” , and thus he began a wretched phase in life , denounced and beaten at every turn .
Back then , the demonstrations were largely motivated by concern for the fate of the nation and a desire to see democratic freedoms put in place .

Protests worsen Tung 's bad marks PUBLISHED : Friday , 30 June , 2000 , 12:00am IN THE RUN-UP TO tomorrow 's third anniversary of the return to Chinese sovereignty , sporadic calls for the downfall of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa emerged in a rally by flat owners whose properties have become negative assets , following the massive slump in flat prices .
Although these only represented a minority and disorganised voice - even among those present at last Sunday 's protest - this was still enough to set alarm bells ringing that discontent with the Government 's performance in recent years might spin out of control and pose a serious challenge to the authority of Mr Tung 's leadership .
These aspirations were behind the series of demonstrations and rallies held last Sunday .
' The senior official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , observed that protests by professionals such as teachers , social workers and doctors were by no means a grave concern as all these groups were targeting specific policies .
The decision of the unions affiliated to the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Panchayat to end the agitation came after a 45 - minute long meeting between Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and four union representatives Sharad Rao , Dada Samant , Vithalrao Gaikwad and Narayan Phenani at the CM 's residence late on Wednesday night .
The strike was called off after the CM personally intervened to hold an hour-long meeting with Mayor Nandu Satam , BEST Chairman Arvind Nerkar , Rao and other union leaders earlier in the day .
The fate of an application filed by the BEST today at the industrial courts , seeking derecognition of the striking unions , hangs in balance .
The semi-autonomous city has been shaken by historic demonstrations in the past month , when protesters have demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland .
While an official ceremony took place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to mark the 22nd anniversary of the return of sovereignty from Britain to China , tensions spiked once more in the financial hub after hundreds of mainly young , masked protesters mostly in black wearing hard hats and goggles seized three key thoroughfares , some deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way .
The ongoing rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city ’ s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub ’ s pro-Beijing leaders .
This year ’ s rally comes against the backdrop of unprecedented anti-government protests over the past three weeks that have drawn millions and anger over police using tear gas and rubber bullets to clear crowds .
Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China , where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party .
The protests throughout June have been largely peaceful , but on 12 June , the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets , teargas , pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police .
While the spark for the current wave of protests was an attempt by chief executive Carrie Lam to pass the Beijing-backed extradition law , the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against Lam ’ s administration and Beijing .
Lam – who has kept out of the public eye since her climbdown and has record low approval ratings – struck a conciliatory note Monday at the ceremony marking the handover , saying a series of protests that have rocked her city have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general .
On Sunday , thousands of pro-government protesters rallied outside the government headquarters in support of the city ’ s police .
The spontaneous protests come after the country has seen a number of violent crimes directed at women and children which have made headlines in recent weeks and left the country reeling .
On Wednesday , a crowd , made up of mainly young people from various civil community organisations and students from universities and schools across the city , gathered outside the CTICC , chanting struggle songs and holding posters on which was written `` enough is enough '' and `` stop killing women and children '' .
The protesters , during the gathering on Wednesday said they were not willing to listen to any government official and demanded that Ramaphosa come out to address them on how he is planning to stop the scourge of abuse directed at women and children in the country .
